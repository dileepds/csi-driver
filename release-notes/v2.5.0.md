## Resolved Issues

The following table lists the resolved issues for HPE CSI Driver for Kubernetes v2.5.0.

| ID | Component | Title | Resolution |
|----|-----------|-------|------------|
| CON-648  | csi.k8s | Implement basic topology in the CSI driver | StorageClasses may now be decorated with topology requirements and use volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer |
| CON-2508 | csi.k8s | Post reboot and drained worker nodes are not cleaned up properly unless manually tidied up | Safely removing stale mount paths or devices attached to a compute node. |
| CON-3071 | csi.k8s | CSI node monitor support | A node monitor is now patrolling the block devices to ensure they're healthy. |
| CON-2137 | csi.k8s | Run filesystem check before mount | Checking for filesystem corruption and optionally repair it with the fsRepair StorageClass parameter. |
| CON-3082 | csp.3par | Cloning RWO to RWX does not apply multiInitiator in CRD | While cloning any RWO volume, adding the multiInitiator flag if the target volume access mode is RWX. |
| CON-3088 | csp.3par | MultiInitiator does not get set during volume import | Adding the "multi_initiator" flag if the target volume access mode is Block RWX during the volume import. |
| CON-3090 | csp.3par | Change importVol parameter to importVolumeName for 3PAR CSP | Making the parameter consistent with the CSI/CSP naming convention. |
| CON-3051 | csi.k8s | CHAP need to use a Secret instead of a ConfigMap | Moved the CHAP user credentials to CHAP secret instead of populating a Helm value parameter in a ConfigMap.|
| CON-3099 | csi.k8s | PVs created in CSI Driver version 2.4.2 or lower version lose CHAP details in 2.5.0 | Support backward compatibility for existing PVs using CHAP authentication already. |
| CON-3080 | csi.k8s | CHAP enables iSCSI initiators trying to establish session and fail indefinitely leading to flood of events followed by FW cores and iostack panics. | Not deleting the host definition if the volume is using CHAP authentication with a Helm chart parameter disableHostDeletion. |
| CON-2867 | csp.nimble | Unable to import offline vVols into Kubernetes | Set agent_type to "none" during forceImport. |
| CON-3064 | csi.k8s | Implement nfsResourceRequestCpuM and nfsResourceRequestsMemoryMi | Added request limits for CPU and Memory resources. |
| CON-3106 | csi.k8s | The hpe-csi-node Pods are consuming more than 100GiB of memory on nodes | Implemented resource requests and limits on all containers in the HPE CSI Driver. |
| CON-3094 | csi.k8s | CSI Operator controller manager gets OOMkilled | Doubled the default memory limit. |
| CON-3087 | csi.k8s | Use Red Hat branded Operator SDK for OpenShift | Replaced references in HPE CSI Operator with images from registry.redhat.io |
| CON-3092 | csi.k8s | ClusterRoles conflicts with other CSI drivers | Prefixed ClusterRoles with 'hpe-csi'. |
| CON-2930 | csi.k8s | All images needs to be part of the Operator manifests to allow offline install via digest | Added all images to the Helm chart used by the CSI driver. |
| CON-3085 | csi.k8s | Refactor the Helm template logic to parameterize all images | Added "images" to the Helm chart. | 
| CON-3086 | csi.k8s | NFS Server Provisioner is hardcoded in the CSI driver | Moved the default NFS server image to a runtime changeable parameter. |
| CON-3003 | csi.k8s | Ubuntu gets a deprecated multipath.conf | Changed getuid method to ID_SERIAL. |
| CON-3084 | csi.k8s | Allow arbitrary NFS node label values | Implemented an nfsNodeSelector StorageClass parameter. |
