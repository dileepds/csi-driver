|--------------|-----|
| **Revision:** | Monday January 13, 2025 |

## Resolved Issues

The following table lists the resolved issues for HPE CSI Driver for Kubernetes v2.5.2.

| ID | Component | Title | Resolution |
|----|-----------|-------|------------|
| CON-3014 | csp.3par | Support LDAP users in Primera/3PAR. | Customers can use LDAP users for their Kubernetes admins. |
| CON-3112 | csp.3par | Fixing excessive restarts of 3PAR CSP. | Fixed the issue by using a sync map instead of a normal map for avoiding concurrent issues. |
| CON-3120 | csi.k8s | Remove volumeAccessMode from volumeAttributes and use volumeMode instead. | Support backup vendors that attaches block mode volume snapshots as filesystem to perform backup of KubeVirt. |
| CON-3116 | csp.3par | Unable to restore from a snapshot when its parent PVC is deleted. | Primera CSP will not allow customer to delete a PVC when snapshots exists for that PVC. |
| CON-3123 | csp.3par | PVC clone fails when multiple clone operation executed within 1 minute of interval. | Use unique names for the snapshots created as part of clone operations. |
| CON-3126 | csp.3par | PVC creation failing for peer persistence enabled volumes with error "specified target is not a target of RCG". | Removed the extra validation which was looking for a match on target system name with the defined remote copy group target name. |
| CON-3131 | csp.3par | CSI Driver stuck in a loop of dismissing VV from remote copy group when the sync operation happens between primary and secondary array. | Array now support admitting and dismissing volumes without stopping remote copy group and now CSP enhanced to adjust this. |
| CON-3132 | csi.k8s | Remove the use of SSH and port 22 in CSI Driver. | Customer can use a modified secret with backend details of storage system IP along with the port if they want to avoid SSH. |
| CON-3127 | csp.3par | Unpublish not removing VLUNs from secondary array for peer persistence enabled volumes. | Modifying the CRD with updated publish information in the case of adding a published volume to remote copy group through volume mutation. |
| CON-3128 | csp.3par | Adding PVC to RCG fails when used with annotation method and Cloneof parameter. | Added mutation support for clone operation of volume in a remote copy group. |
| CON-2549 | csi.k8s | Support volume expansion for NFS volumes. | Handle the resize request for NFS volumes (all access modes). |
| CON-3095 | csi.k8s | CSI Driver panics due to excessive locking. | Fixed the issue by using a sync map instead of a normal map for avoiding concurrent issues. |
| CON-3142 | csp.3par | CSI Driver creates two exports to the same worker node with different LUN IDs causing POD deployment failures. | Avoid creating duplicate export when the volume is already exported to a node. |
| CON-3133 | csi.k8s | CSI Driver failed to create iSCSI sessions with storage system on Alletra MP 10.4.2. | Included new vendor name in the iqn format which validate the new iqn value in Alletra MP 10.4.2 as valid. |
| CON-3145 | csi.k8s | Fix linter issues in go code. | Refactored the code to fix linter issues seen during linter checks or static analysis |
| CON-3023 | csi.k8s | Allow configuration of MAX_VOLUMES_PER_NODE in the Helm chart/operator. | Added new parameter 'maxVolumesPerNode' to the chart which can be configured. |
| CON-3180| csi.k8s | Option to disable pre-install hook for the operator. | Introduced a switch to disable the pre-install hook. |
| CON-3181 | csi.k8s | Change operator build to use a local chart as source. | Operator bundle image will be created along with Helm chart. | 

## Known Issues

The following table lists the known issues for HPE CSI Driver for Kubernetes v2.5.2. Please note that, `Known Issues` from previous releases are still applicable with suggested workarounds, if they are not part of `Resolved Issues` above.

|ID|Component |Title|Description|
|--|---------|-----|-----------|
| CON-3078 | csi.k8s | CSI Driver needs to honor access protocol specified in Storage Class and create host definition using that protocol. | CSI Driver should create hosts based on the access protocol defined in the Storage Class. |
| CON-3113 | csi.k8s | hpe-nfs pods gets into ContainerCreateError in case of path loss. | Based on the health restart NFS pods to ensure that it is not deadlocked or unresponsive. |
| CON-3129 | csi.k8s | Replication not created for the volume that is used for Openshift Vm. | Replication not created for the volume on array even though SC has pointers towards replication CRD. |
| CON-3125 | csi.k8s | VMs created on openshift goes to paused stated due to disk i/o errors. | Customer facing an issue of nodes going into unresponsive state. |
